# Create a project (simple-web) with the following package.json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"express": "*"
	},
	"scripts": {
		"start": "node index.js"
	}
}

and the following index.js
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send("Hello World mate <3");
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
	console.log("Server is running on port 8080");
});

- Test that everything is working
- Create the base image to run this -> Check what happens
- Solve the problem with the base image -> Check what happens now
- Solve the problem with the missing files -> Check what happens now
- Solve the problem with the ports -> Check what happens now
- Ensure that your app is working in a separated directory
- Ensure you have no unnecesary installing the dependencies when you change source files
