--------------------------- Module 6 -----------------------------

- Arreglar notas de Docker
    - Create a react app called frontend
    - Create now the Dockerfile.dev, inside a Docker folder  ( !!!! note the .dev and write about this )
        - Create the Docker file for dev ( use the node:16-alpine ) to run the app.
        - Include notes about docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .
        - And try it, you'll see an error about the port
        - Now, solve it :D
        - Check how changes are not reflected
        - We are going to solve this with Docker volumes
            - Docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image_id> --> Notion notes about this, although we should not need to add the first -v as we do have node_modules ( note about this too )
            - Try that this is working
        
    - Now, lets move to Docker compose
        - Create the docker-compose.yml
            - Specify the service react-app
            - Specify the build
            - Specify the ports
            - Specify the volumes:
                - /app/node_modules
                - .:/app
        - This will fail because of the build, as we are not indicating the Dockerfile.dev
            - Add to the build
                context: . ( folder where docker needs to search )
                dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
        - Is there something to remove from anywhere? If so, leave a note about why do you leave it / remove it
        
    - Now, lets try to run the tests within the docker container
        - Try it. ( did you do it correctly from the beginning? If so, well done ;), If not, include what you know
        

    - But, tests are not being updated whenever we update them. We can solve this in two ways
        - We can start our container, then attach to it and run the tests --> Try this & try that it gets updated
        - But the 'good' approach would be to update our docker-compose to handle this.
            - Second service in docker-compose
                - tests:
                    - copying the previous one but without the ports as we don't need it
                    - Add command: ["npm", "run", "test"]

    - Lets now go for the production version of out app
        - We need to build a Dockerfile for production but we are going to have 2 phases in that dockerfile: Build ( To install dependencies y do the build using one base image ) & Run ( by specifying another build image and run our project )
            -  Get the configuration for the build phase: Base image node:16-alpine and tag is as builder + copy package.json + install dependencies + run build, take care with this last one
            -  Second block for the build phase
                - FROM nginx, then copy whats in the build folder into ./ ( COPY --from=builder /app/build to specify that we want to copy something from the builder phase /usr/share/nxing/html because of nginx documentation)
                - No command to run since Nginx will autostart
            - Test this ( 4200:80 ( base nginx port) )
